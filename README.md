# MOSA

This Repository contains items that link to the data paper from Leirs et al: **Twenty-nine years of continuous monthly capture-mark-recapture data of multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis) in Morogoro, Tanzania.**

We included:
- **mosa_Feb2023_flags**: the raw CMR data csv file since 1994, including flags for errors that were corrected from the field list.

- **C_primary_secondary_capture_3consecutive_o_1_10000b.csv** and **C_primary_secondary_capture_3consecutive_o_10000-20000b.csv**: these two csv files  provide the encounter   matrix that is used in the Rmarkdown file 3. I had to split one original file in two because Github only allows to upload files until 25MB.

- **C_primary_secondary_time_variables_3consecutive_m2.csv**: A csv file with all the time variables per capture session that is used in the Rmarkdown file 3

- Four different **RMarkdown files** that provide an introduction to the system (1), how we processed the data (2), a density and survival analyses (3) and serological information (antibodies against Morogoro arenavirus) of the rodents.
